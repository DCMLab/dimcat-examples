# dimcat examples

This repo demonstrates how to read harmonic annotations in the ABC corpus,
compute note slices, and match slices and labels.


The version on this branch has been updated to use [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/) which
lets you version-control Jupyter notebooks in the form of text files without creating diffs on the
outputs. Once you've installed Jupytext, you can open the `.py` or `.md` file in jupyter notebook/lab
which will create the `.ipynb` notebook for you which you can run and edit to your liking. 
Jupytext links it to the `.py` and `.md` representation (later we might opt for only one, or for
a different solution such as [Codebraid](https://codebraid.org/)).

In order to make sure that the text files are synchronized to your notebook the moment you commit,
you can [install add this pre-commit hook](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#i-have-modified-a-text-file-but-git-reports-no-diff-for-the-paired-ipynb-file).

## Running the notebooks

* clone the corpus: `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:DCMLab/romantic_piano_corpus.git`
* create new environment, make it visible to your Jupyter
  * for conda do `conda create --name {name} python=3.10`
  * activate it and install `pip install ipykernel`
  * `ipython kernel install --user --name={name}`
* within the new environment, install requirements, e.g. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * this currently involves installing dimcat from its `ms3_new` branch
* head into the clone of romantic_piano_corpus and run `ms3 extract -X -M -N`
* open up jupyter notebook or jupyter lab and open either the `.md` or the `.py` file ([documentation](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/paired-notebooks.html#how-to-open-scripts-with-either-the-text-or-notebook-view-in-jupyter))
* Set the `corpus_path` in the second cell to your local clone.
